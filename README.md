This small website has been created as a project for the course of "Security of Multimedia Application" at University of Udine in 2014. The main purpose is to show in a very simple way how crypt and decrypt works in 5 different ciphers, specifically:
- Rail Fence
- Caesar
- Vigen√®re
- AES
- RSA

The second purpose is to implement the site following these prerequisites:
- site can be accessed only after logging in
- account datas must be saved in a database
- password must be stored hashed
- personal account page to edit personal info must be present
- login/logout must be handled using sessions and cookies

The project is built using CodeIgniter and page templates for the UI, using the MVC approach and leveraging several security features offered by the framework.
